The poor, doomed fighter.  Once a fighter under [Mister Shackle], his reputation was lost after he was accused of throwing a fight.  His initial round of implants were what took him from a nobody to a chamption, but those implants were the control that [Mister Shackle] used to cement an iron hold on him.  After he was of no more use, he was kicked to the curb.

His initial, more normal fighting implants were once maintained by [Tael]

How he became involved with [Betel Ice Flower] is still uncertain.
